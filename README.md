# APC Event Updater

This is a React app that handles creating, updating, and deleting events from the APC event database. It integrates with supabase on the backend.

This is intended to be an "internal" only tool, to greatly expedite the process of keeping our database up to date. That being said, this work could serve as the basis of allowing in-website edits in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the jest-based test runner.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
